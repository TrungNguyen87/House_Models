# House Models archive HAN Control Systems Engineering (HAN Lectoraat M&R) #

## MatLab, SimuLink and Python code ##

This repository contains code for the House Models used in  HAN CSE projects.

Let's try to keep files organised in a clear directory structure as much as possible, anticipating the growth
of the number of code and data files.  Currently, we have (planned):

* 1R1C house model/		- MatLab grey box thermal house model with training set.
* House model HHS/ 		- house models Arie BS06 (detached), BS07 (row house) and BS08 (row house). Used in HP-Launch.
* Model Arie BS06/ 		- house model Arie BS06 (detached)
* Various reports/

Please do NOT use SPACES or EXOTIC SYMBOLS in file and directory names.  Let's stick to `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and `.-_`.
`.-_`.
